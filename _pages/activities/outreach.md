Outreach is a core knowledge exchange activity of most DRI projects. Presenting DRI work at all relevant international conferences, meetings, and events is expensive and laborious. CAKE presents DRI as an umbrella at various national and international events and provides other projects the opportunity to showcase their work with minimal effort.


CAKE champions booth presence and logistics almost as a service: DRI projects provide us with outreach materials, handouts, videos, and presentations, and we present them at the venue. This coordinated outreach is part of CAKE's central mission and increases value for money on the DRI projects' side, while freeing projects to focus on their primary work.
