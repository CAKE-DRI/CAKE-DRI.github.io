## Amplifying the impact of UK DRI 

Outreach is a core part of knowledge exchange activities for most DRI projects. However, presenting your work at _every_ relevant international conference, meeting, or event can be expensive and time-consuming. CAKE presents DRI as an umbrella at major national and international events, providing individual projects the chance to showcase their work with minimal effort.

We handle booth presence and logistics almost like a a service: you provide outreach materials, handouts, videos, and presentations, and we present them at the venue. This coordinated outreach approach is part of CAKE's central mission to increase value for money, raise the visibility of your project, and lets you focus on your core work.
