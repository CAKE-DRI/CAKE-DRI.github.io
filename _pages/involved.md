We’re excited to welcome new contributors! Whether you’re an expert or just getting started, looking for help or offering solutions, sharing events or opportunities, or simply wanting to support others — there are plenty of ways to get involved. 

{% include feature_row %}    

CAKE is here to help the DRI community share knowledge and discover what’s happening across our diverse and busy community! Here’s how you can help:

* Join the community → meet us at [events](/events/), jump into conversations on Slack, and help shape the discussion
* Showcase your work → highlight your [projects](/landscape/), advertise upcoming [events or training opportunities](/events), or post [updates](/news/) to our blog
* Build up the knowledge base → contribute guides, tutorials, and resources to [CAKEbox](https://cake-dri.github.io/CAKEbox/) so others can learn from your expertise
* Spread the word → write a [blog](/news/), share (soon!) on social media, and invite your colleagues to get involved

Check out our **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/CAKE-DRI/cake.github.io)** for instructions on how to add to the CAKE website.
