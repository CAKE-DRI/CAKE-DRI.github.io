**Call for Reviewers: Join the CAKE Review Committee! **

The Computational Abilities Knowledge Exchange (CAKE) project aims to facilitate knowledge exchange (KE) and sustainable collaboration across the full range of UK Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) communities. 

We are currently seeking reviewers to join the CAKE Review Committee.

- We aim to ensure reviewer workload is distributed fairly across the committee and will monitor how many assignments each reviewer receives throughout the year.
