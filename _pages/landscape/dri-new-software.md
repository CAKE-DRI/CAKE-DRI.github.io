These projects have focus on making research software more sustainable, reliable, and reusable by treating it as critical infrastructure, not just a byâ€‘product of projects. The programme aims to improve how software is developed, maintained, governed, discovered, and supported across disciplines, so researchers can build on robust, shared tools rather than reinventing them.
