GPU eCSE support provides funding to the UKRI research community to develop software in a sustainable manner to run on GPU-based architectures. Projects focus on developing software that facilitates research targeted at UKRIâ€™s digital research infrastructure e.g. future Exascale supercomputing services, UK national AI services, national Tier-2 HPC services.
