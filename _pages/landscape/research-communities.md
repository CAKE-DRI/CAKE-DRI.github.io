UKRI funds numerous domain-specific computational research communities as long-term adaptable mechanism to maximise research value and impact, enable collaboration and facilitate knowledge exchange. These allow for collective strategic thinking around the development and maintenance of key software, data curation and driving research challenges and are a key element of the UK's DRI strategy.
