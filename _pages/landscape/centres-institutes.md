The UKRI DRI contains a number of high-level Centres and Institutes that provide strategic leadership and enablement. Each acts as a focal point for a key element of the DRI, ensuring national resources are sensibly utilised and overlapping interests are explored. These are key delivery mechanisms for UKRI's goals for DRI, helping to set strategy in work done as well as contributing to overall national policy.
