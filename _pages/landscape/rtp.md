The UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) programme supports the development of two national hubs for digital Research Technology Professionals (RTP) for accelerated compute.
These hubs enable skills development, education and training for the digital professionals within accelerated and large-scale compute who support science across the entire UKRI remit.

## ACIT Hub

**Lead: Helen Cooper (Surrey)**

The hub will offer translational training in essential skills and work with universities and existing accrediting bodies to provide a professionally recognised talent pool that can drive uptake, in research and industry, of efficient methodologies for deploying, maintaining and using accelerated compute infrastructure. The hub recognises the diversity of backgrounds present in the RIE community and it will reflect this across all training and CPD events. 


By providing bespoke training courses and events covering accelerators, networking, storage, and orchestration and management software, highlighting both the fundamental and applied applications of the latest Accelerated Compute technologies, including when to ‘burst to cloud’. This comprehensive and agile training will be co-designed and developed by expert RTPs to ensure that it is relevant, and accessible to all. 


## SHAREing

Digital computing platforms, from sensors to supercomputers, are vital for many branches of research and innovation. Increasingly, they are either accelerated by special-purpose hardware - notably in the realm of AI - or act themselves as accelerators to traditional digital research infrastructure (DRI). Such accelerated compute has the potential to drive transformational change in the frontiers of knowledge through enhanced productivity, yet if, and only if, sufficient expertise is available to translate research ambition into technical solutions.

SHAREing will

1. foster an ecosystem in which RTPs and other stakeholders can design, prototype and assess the best accelerated software-hardware combination for their research, i.e. pioneer solutions.
2. establish structured learning, including upskilling pathways, such that RTPs can acquire all skills to realise accelerated computing projects and to subsequently train others.
3. showcase how RTPs’ interventions enable significant research innovation if they transform into dev-ops that lead accelerate computing projects.
