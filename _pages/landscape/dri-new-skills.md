The focuses of these projects is on growing and sustaining the UK’s digital research workforce—spanning researchers and research technical professionals such as research software engineers, data stewards/scientists, and research infrastructure engineers. It invests in coordinated, scalable training from foundational digital and data skills to advanced HPC, cloud, AI/ML, research software engineering, cybersecurity, and FAIR/Open data practices; delivers cohorts, fellowships and placements; and develops shared, open learning resources that can be reused across disciplines and institutions. Alongside training, it strengthens career pathways and recognition (including progression frameworks and professional development), embeds equality, diversity and inclusion, and links academia, national facilities and industry so that skills keep pace with evolving technologies and can be applied effectively across the UK research and innovation system.
