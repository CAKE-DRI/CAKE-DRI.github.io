<!-- **DRI Knowledge Exchange Placements and Visits** -->

We aim to facilitate knowledge exchange and sustainable collaboration across the full range of UK Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) communities through financial support for placements and visits. The intention is that this will enable the community to spark fresh collaborations and lasting partnerships that help to shape the future of the DRI landscape.
 
### What makes CAKE different? 
Unlike existing placement schemes, CAKE is deliberately flexible and inclusive, opening up opportunities that often fall through the cracks. For example:
- International opportunities to support outward-facing collaboration beyond the UK.
- For those unable to travel, CAKE offers structured remote placements with regular check-ins, tailored support, and logistical coordination.
- A defined framework to help hosts and participants get the most from their placement or visit.

This flexibility means that placements are open to a wider pool of participants, including those who might not normally be able to access such opportunities.

### Scope
The CAKE Placements and Visits Programme provides support primarily for travel and subsistence (T&S) costs to enable placements and visits for the UK DRI community. 

We define a placement and visit opportunity as including (but not limited to): 
- Short-term collaborative placements between institutions or organisations
- Visits to share best practices, tools, or infrastructure approaches
- Engagements that foster cross-disciplinary or cross-sector collaboration within the DRI ecosystem
- Attendance at community workshops, training and events

For larger award requests (over £6,000) or non-T&S related costs, please contact the CAKE management team (cake-management@mlist.ed.ac.uk) to discuss eligibility.

### Eligibility 
Applicants must be from UK institutions which are eligible for UKRI funding. Whilst the money will be awarded to the applying institution it can, for example, be used to cover expenses of those travelling from other countries to the UK. 

Awards are granted at 80% FEC, applicants must confirm their institution is able to cover the remaining 20%. 

PhD students are eligible to apply, provided they include a letter of support from their primary supervisor emailed to the CAKE management team alongside their application. 

### Timeline 
The CAKE Placements and Visits Programme runs from October 2025 through to April 2028, at which time all visits must be complete and expenses claimed.


### Application process

There is a rolling deadline of the 1st of each month, where applications received by then will be collated and reviewed. Each application will be assessed by a minimum of four reviewers from the CAKE Review Committee.

The following reviewing criteria will be applied:
- Importance of the benefits from this visit and UKRI-wide relevance of specific outputs (40%), 
- Potential to drive long term collaboration (20%), 
- Eminence of the partners in HPC and/or the specific field being investigated (10%), 
- Appropriateness of the time plan and value for money (10%), 
- Consideration of environmental impact (10%), 
- Link to DRI projects and activities (10%).

We aim for all decisions to be communicated within 4-6 weeks from when the application was submitted. 

Successful applicants will receive their allocated funds from the flexible funding stream for this programme which is held by the University of Edinburgh. The process for disbursing these funds will be confirmed at the point where successful applicants are notified of the outcome of their applications.

### Outputs
Successful applicants are required to complete a short written report detailing the activities undertaken during the placement or visit and any outcomes. A recorded presentation or interview summarising the visit is also required and will be posted to the network’s YouTube channel - placements and visits which include community workshops and events are encouraged and may provide a suitable venue for this. 

Documentary evidence must be kept to show how the allocated funds have been spent.

### EDI
We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment, reflecting the diversity of the CAKE network and wider UK DRI community. We actively encourage applications from all members of the community, regardless of background, discipline, or career stage.

- To uphold this commitment, we provide: 
- Best practice guidance to ensure successful placements and visits 
- Mentoring opportunities for all applicants
- Match-making… 
- Best practice guidance for reviewers to support fair, respectful, and constructive reviews

All engaged in the CAKE network must abide by the CAKE Code of Conduct, ensuring a supportive and respectful environment for everyone involved.
