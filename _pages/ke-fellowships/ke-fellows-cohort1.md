# Our first cohort of DRI Knowledge Exchange Fellows

The CAKE team is very excited to introduce the first cohort of KE Fellows! These fellows will start their twelve-months term in January 2026, and will play a crucial part in shaping the CAKE community.

We are looking forward to see how their projects will develop over the coming year.

## Joe Wallwork
### Fortran index: Facilitating better knowledge exchange within the Fortran community

Many high quality learning resources and tools have been developed for the Fortran programming language over its seven decades of usage. However, their visibility is generally poor in the community. This fellowship builds on the work of the [Fortran index](https://github.com/fortran-index/fortran-index) hackathon series to facilitate better sharing of knowledge by making adding to, correcting, and curating the information presented in the [fortran-lang](https://fortran-lang.org/) community resource.

## Lewis Sampson
### Basic introductions for the DRI community to the benefits and processes of Kubernetes. 

This fellowship aims to introduce members of the DRI community to the container orchestration platform Kubernetes (K8s). This platform is widely used throughout industry but has not been utilised as much across academia. Although not a one size fits all solution for research infrastructure, I am hoping to break the ice into the K8s world for RSEs, enable them to feel comfortable experimenting with the platform, and bring relevant members of the community together to encourage shared resources and reduced duplication of effort.
