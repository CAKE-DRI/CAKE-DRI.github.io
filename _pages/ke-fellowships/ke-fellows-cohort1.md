# Our first cohort of DRI Knowledge Exchange Fellows

The CAKE team is very excited to introduce the first cohort of KE Fellows! These fellows will start their twelve-months term in January 2026, and will play a crucial part in shaping the CAKE community.

We are looking forward to see how their projects will develop over the coming year.
