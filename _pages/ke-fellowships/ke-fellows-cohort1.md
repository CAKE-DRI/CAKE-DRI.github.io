# Our first cohort of DRI Knowledge Exchange Fellows

The CAKE team is very excited to introduce the first cohort of KE Fellows! These fellows will start their twelve-months term in January 2026, and will play a crucial part in shaping the CAKE community.

We are looking forward to see how their projects will develop over the coming year.

### Fortran index: Facilitating better knowledge exchange within the Fortran community

Many high quality learning resources and tools have been developed for the Fortran programming language over its seven decades of usage. However, their visibility is generally poor in the community. This fellowship builds on the work of the [Fortran index](https://github.com/fortran-index/fortran-index) hackathon series to facilitate better sharing of knowledge by making adding to, correcting, and curating the information presented in the [fortran-lang](https://fortran-lang.org/) community resource.
