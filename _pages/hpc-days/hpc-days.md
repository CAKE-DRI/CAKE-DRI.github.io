Durham HPC Days 2026: Theme TBC
 
Durham University, Department of Computer Science, Durham, UK

16th June - 20th June 2026
 

Following successful events for the past few years, we are happy to announce the 2026 Durham HPC Days in the week predating the ISC Conference in Hamburg. Our 2026 theme focuses on TBC. However, different communities have different needs how the HPC infrastructure is used and provided, and they also affect each other. Following this “difference but common interests”, we will attempt to bring disciplines to Durham which had been underrepresented in previous years.
