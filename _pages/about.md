The Computational Abilities Knowledge Exchange (CAKE) Network+ is dedicated to providing a sense of community within the Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) programme and the UK’s wider large-scale computing community. Outward facing and keen to attract new communities, this network is a central hub that brings projects together to enable them to share their successes, achievements and explore how to most effectively work together and leverage each other’s work.

We remove barriers that prevent effective knowledge exchange: taking care of the best practices, tools and resources, so you can focus on connecting, collaborating and driving progress.

## What we provide

- **Outreach** CAKE represents DRI projects on national and international  conferences such as CIUK or the Supercomputing conference series. If your project has outreach material (give aways, posters, videos, flyers, ...)  but you do not want to go the events yourself, CAKE can accept your dissemination material and ensure it is presented to our target audience.
- **Best Practices** Designing EDI guidelines, code of conducts, conference instructions, ... can quickly become an overwhelming task. CAKE collects templates for these tasks to allow projects to focus on their unique core mission.

## Engage

CAKE realises the majority of its day-to-day work through a joint Slack.  The Slack is open to the whole UK community and friends. To receive an invite please contact the <a href="mailto:cake-management@mlist.is.ed.ac.uk">CAKE management</a>.
