title: "What is CAKE?"
layout: title-page
---

The Computational Abilities Knowledge Exchange (CAKE) Network+ is dedicated to providing a sense of community within the Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) programme and the UK’s wider large-scale computing community. Outward facing and keen to attract new communities, this network is a central hub that brings projects together to enable them to share their successes, achievements and explore how to most effectively work together and leverage each other’s work.

We remove barriers that prevent effective knowledge exchange: taking care of the best practices, tools and resources, so you can focus on connecting, collaborating and driving progress.

## What we provide

- **Support:** CAKE runs events and [fellowship programmes](/about/ke-fellowships) to facilitate and encourage knowledge exchange between the various DRI projects and the wider UK community.
- **Outreach:** CAKE represents DRI projects on national and international conferences, such as CIUK and the Supercomputing conference series. If your project has outreach material - giveaways, posters, videos, flyers, etc. - but you're unable to attend, CAKE can present your materials to the right audience on your behalf. 
- **Best Practices:** Developing EDI guidelines, Code of Conducts, conference instructions, and similar resources can quickly become an overwhelming task. CAKE collects templates and examples to help projects focus on their unique core mission while maintaining high standards.

## Engage

Most of CAKE's day-to-day collaboration happens [on Slack](/involved/), which is open to the whole UK community and friends. This community is just getting started, so head on over to get involved! 

# Partners

We are proud to be supported by the following project partners and thank them for their continued support and advice.
