Nektar++ (https://gitlab.nektar.info/nektar/nektar/) is a modern open-source spectral/hp element framework for the high-fidelity numerical solution of partial differential equations, based on high-order spectral/hp element methods. It is a flagship code of the UK Turbulence Consortium and is widely utilised by academic researchers across the UK and worldwide, as well as industrial partners including Rolls-Royce, McLaren and the UK Atomic Energy Authority.

This project seeks to enable a dedicated period of essential development to transition the two key fluid dynamics solvers of Nektar++ to be fully GPU-ready, platform-independent, and performance-portable, suitable for the current and next generation of Tier 0, Tier 1 and Tier 2 facilities world-wide.
