OpenFOAM is the world’s leading Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code with an estimated 50,000 users worldwide and a remarkable level of penetration into both academic research and industrial use. It is one of the top codes used on ARCHER2 and is the top CFD code on that platform. Use cases include aerospace, automotive, marine/offshore renewables, chemical process, combustion, all aspects of turbulence modelling and multiphase/multiphysics/coupled simulation, biomedical and many others beside.

Because of the nature of the governing equations, effective use of GPU computing power is a cutting edge challenge in CFD. The objective of the proposed project is to make use of state of the art knowledge in this area to develop and validate a GPU-enabled version of OpenFOAM, which will be distributed and maintained going forwards in alignment with the Open Source principles of the code. Given the reach and penetration of OpenFOAM in CFD and applications, developing and releasing a GPU-enabled version of OpenFOAM would provide extreme impact and significance.
