Our long-term research program focuses on advancing governing models and numerical methods for unsteady turbulent flows, which are then employed to deliver substantially improved fundamental understanding of turbulent flows including mixing and reacting problems. This is of central importance in geophysics, oceanography, meteorology, astrophysics, engineering, combustion and fusion science. It is directly aligned with EPSRC frontiers in engineering and technology in the strategic areas hypersonics, fluid dynamics and fusion. This project proposes (i) OpenMP offloading of core algorithms of the very high order solver compressible, multispecies Navier-Stokes solver Flamenco, and (ii) foundation of a new solver through the integration of world-leading algorithms in Flamenco with the AMReX-based solver Cerisse developed at Imperial College. These will ensure that UK research in this field remains leading worldwide. Direct impact on industry is through (i) Atomic Weapons Establishment, who will fully fund a PhD student to explore mixing relevant to inertial confinement fusion using the developed codes, (ii) Thales UK, who intend to support a PhD student to advance airframe aerodynamics analysis and (iii) First Light Fusion, to inform the development of their in-house solvers for inertial fusion energy. All partners also highlight the importance of fundamental understanding to be delivered. Broader impact is pursued through open-sourcing, journal and conference dissemination.
