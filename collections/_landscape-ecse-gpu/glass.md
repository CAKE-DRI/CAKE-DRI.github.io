The proposed project turns GLASS, the Generator for Large Scale Structure, into a modern Python GPU code. GLASS is a unique code used in the field of Cosmology to create fast and accurate simulations of the full universe as observed by current and future galaxy surveys. In its current CPU form, GLASS will not be able to fulfil its critical role for the next generation of Cosmology surveys. The project aims to leverage Python's Array API to transform the existing code so that it scales from a single CPU on a student laptop to the largest GPU clusters in the UK national infrastructure. This will not only be critical to deliver the volume of simulations that upcoming Cosmology missions require, but also enable completely new venues of cosmological analysis, such as differentiable simulations, simulation-based inference, and exploitation of ML/AI methods.
