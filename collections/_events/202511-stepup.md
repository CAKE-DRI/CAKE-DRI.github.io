There are many repositories of excellent dRTP training, e.g. the Carpentries, CodeRefinery, ELIXIR, HDR UK Futures, DRESA… So if we’re developing new training, how do we make sure we’re (1) not duplicating effort and (2) developing training for all the skills needed? This workshop is for anyone involved in developing, delivering, or investing in skills training for research software, data, and computing infrastructure professionals.
