This workshop will bring together the UK radio astronomy community to understand how artificial intelligence and data-driven methods will shape SKA-era science, and to ensure the UK’s digital infrastructure, including the UK’s SKA Regional Centre (ukSRC), is ready for the data-intensive challenges ahead. Hosted at the Royal Observatory Edinburgh (ROE), the workshop is jointly organised by the UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UK ATC), the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (JBCA), and the ukSRC, and funded by UKRI’s Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI).

This workshop is funded by UKRI’s Digital Research Infrastructure, and financial support is available to a limited number of participants, with priority going to early career researchers. Please register early (by 23rd February) and indicate in the registration form if you’d like to request support; we expect to confirm request by 27th February.

The 1.5-day workshop will be organised around three key areas, where we are soliciting your input:

- Scientific drivers for AI in radio astronomy*: how do you and your team plan to use AI/ML for SKA-related science?
- Technical enablers that make AI adoption possible: what are the computing facilities you will rely on?
- Policy requirements for responsible and effective use of AI/ML: what is your approach to metascience principles such as FAIR data, sustainability, and transparency?

Important Dates:

- 23 February 2026: Abstract Deadline (and request for financial support)
- 10 March 2026: Registration Deadline
- 19-20 March 2026: Workshop at ROE


*While the primary focus of our workshop, survey and study is radio astronomy in the UK, we invite participation from colleagues working in related fields.
