23rd international WHPC workshop: Building Community, Building Career

A key part of our workshop is to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for early-career researchers to present their work at a major international conference, forge valuable networks, and attend their very first SC.

Submissions for talks are invited as extended abstracts (up to 2 pages) in any area that utilizes High Performance Computing. Successful authors will be asked to provide a version of their work highlighting its goals, accomplishments, and impact to present in a short lightning talk (3 minutes) at the workshop.

HPC is a large community that encompasses many different roles, we welcome both technical and non-technical contributors to submit in order to broaden the knowledge of all those to attend our workshop. All abstracts should emphasize the impact of the work, such as the problem you are seeking to solve, the community benefits from investigating this work with or alongside HPC, any challenges noted and/or overcome, as well as any other challenges you wish to highlight. The extended abstracts will be published in a small proceedings to acknowledge your participation in the WHPC workshop.
