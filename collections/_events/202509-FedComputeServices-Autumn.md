Are you a Digital Research Infrastructure user or provider wondering where you’ll be on 22-23 September? 

If you’re interested in helping us shape a federated national compute service and the opportunities this will create, then come join us at our 2nd National Conference. 

This will be a stimulating combination of expert plenaries and focussed experience sharing and problem-solving across a broad agenda including:  

- edge federation
- data movement and management
- inter/transnational collaboration
- the transition from laptop to cluster
- identity and access management
- HPC for non-traditional users

The Conference will also provide an opportunity for partnership building for the Programme’s 2nd Call for DRI Roadmap projects [see here](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/news/2025/08/13/newsletter.html#national-federated-compute-services-networkplus) for registration and more details.
