summary: A one-day hackathon to build performance monitoring dashboards and explore GPU efficiency.
---

We are excited to announce the upcoming Performance Monitoring Hackathon, an in-person event designed to bring together research infrastructure engineers (RIEs), research software engineers (RSEs) and accelerated compute users to develop actionable solutions for accelerated compute (e.g. GPU) performance monitoring, especially on scheduled systems.

This collaborative event will focus on building dashboards, improving efficiency, and sharing knowledge across institutions.

The University of Surrey will be providing Nvidia H200 nodes and the University of Oxford will bring AMD MI300x nodes. Other RIE’s are encouraged to ‘bring’ a node virtually so that results from the day are directly applicable to as many environments as possible.

If you are interested in participating, please complete the Expression of Interest (EOI) Form on our website. Due to the specialised nature and need for balance between the RIE, RSE and user communities, we will carefully select participants to ensure a productive and impactful event.

## Event Highlights

**What:** A one-day hackathon to build performance monitoring dashboards and explore GPU efficiency.
**When:** 21st of April 2026
**Where:** University of Surrey, Guildford, UK
**Who:** Research infrastructure engineers (RIEs),research software engineers (RSEs), users of accelerated compute.

## Why Participate?

* Gain hands-on experience with tools, such as Grafana, CEEMS, and Prometheus.
* Collaborate with experts to identify and solve performance inefficiencies.
* Build useful, actionable dashboards to optimise resource usage.
* Contribute to knowledge-sharing across institutions and teams.

## We are seeking participants who are:

* Early career and experienced RIEs/RSEs/users with an interest in performance monitoring for accelerated compute, especially in scheduled workflows.
* Can bring example workflows for monitoring.
* Are willing to collaborate in small teams (e.g 2 RIEs + 2 RSEs/users) to tackle challenges.
* Have familiarity with monitoring tools or are eager to learn during pre-hackathon prep.

## How to Apply
