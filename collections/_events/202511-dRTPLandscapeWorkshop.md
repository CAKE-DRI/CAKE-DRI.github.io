The Understanding the dRTP Training Landscape Workshop will take place on 5th - 6th November 2025 at Bidborough House, UCL, London. 

This event, funded by the UKRI dRTP Skills NetworkPlus Programme, aims to

* Identify existing dRTP roles,
* Identify existing training courses and resources,
* Link those roles to specific skills / competencies,
* Align those skills / competencies with the existing training materials. 

The workshop will also identify gaps in provision and areas where new or adapted content is needed, and where teams are working on similar materials and could fruitfully collaborate. Those efforts are another step towards making professional skill development easier and improving career prospects across the whole dRTP ecosystem. The workshop outcomes will be shared with the dRTP community.

We are hoping to better outline and understand the whole dRTP ecosystem, therefore, we would like to extend an invitation to dRTPs working in different roles and at different institution types, and engaging with a wide range of research communities.

* Date: 5th - 6th November 2025
