CHARTED (https://drtp-skills.ac.uk/) is organising a session to engage with the dRTP community (research software, research data and research computing infrastructure professionals) in a discussion on what it means for training resources to be FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable - and to gather feedback on the questionnaire created to evaluate FAIRness of existing training resources. Once completed the questionnaire will also be linked to a set of recommendations and practical guides to help improve existing training resources.

Please join us for this interactive session!
