**What is CIUK?**

Since its inception in 1990, this event formerly known as the Machine Evaluation Workshop, combines an exhibition of the latest High Performance Computing (HPC) hardware and software with a programme of presentations from users  who provide delegates with an overview of their use of HPC in real life situations.

The conference programme includes an exhibition of the latest hardware and software releases, a full two-day series of presentations and breakout sessions, the Student Cluster Challenge, plenty of networking opportunities such as the Women in HPC Breakfast, an evening event and much more.
