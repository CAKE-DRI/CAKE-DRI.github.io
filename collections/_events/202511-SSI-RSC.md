The Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) runs Research Software Camps (RSCs), which aim to improve coding literacy by providing attendees with tailored programmes consisting of online workshops; panel discussions; resources such as guides, articles, and videos; and one-to-one support around specific topics within research software. The RSC format prioritises entry-level training while also supporting the transition to intermediate skills.  

This yearâ€™s Research Software Camp, Careers and Skills in Research Software, will be delivered over the course of two weeks as a multi-session event tailored for early-career professionals, recent graduates, and anyone looking to transition into research software roles. Through a combination of hands-on workshops and engaging panel discussions, attendees will gain a strong foundation in both the technical and professional competencies in research software.
