Come along to help define what training you want to see come out of the hub. We'll be discussing learning journeys with talks from RIE's across the hub and beyond. These events are specifically aimed at Research Infrastructure Engineers (RIE's), these are the technical staff who build and maintain accelerated compute clusters. Later on we'll be doing sessions with the Software Sustainability Institute aimed at RSEs and other users but for these events we're focussing on SysOps, Infrastructure Engineers, DevOps and System Administrators.
