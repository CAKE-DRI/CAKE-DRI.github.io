Registration is now open for the hybrid townhall event launching Careers and Skills for Data driven Research (CaSDaR), taking place on Thursday, 18 September 2025, from 09:30 to 16:30 at The Library of Birmingham and online.

As the volume of data continues to grow, so does the critical need for Data Stewards, the professionals who ensure data is shareable, reusable, and FAIR-compliant. Yet in the UK, the role of the Data Steward remains under-defined and often under-recognised.

CaSDaR aims to address this gap by helping to define the role of Data Stewards within the UK research landscape and advocating for their recognition and representation across institutions.

This Townhall will present the current landscape of Data Stewardship in the UK, introduce the mission and goals of CaSDaR, gather your input on what support and recognition you need, and launch a funding call to support Data Stewardship initiatives.

The programme includes:

- Inspiring Data Steward stories
- Contributions from partners including PSDI, UKRN, ELIXIR, and DCC
- Lightning talks from UK and international Data Stewards (all participants have the option to submit lightning talks/posters)
- Interactive discussions with current stewardship initiatives
- Details of the CaSDaR funding call
- 
Registration is open now â€“ to find out more details and secure your spot check out our [Event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/careers-and-skills-for-data-driven-research-casdar-hybrid-event-launch-tickets-1496323607189) page.

We look forward to your participation in shaping the future of Data Stewardship in the UK.
