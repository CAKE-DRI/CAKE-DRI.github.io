summary: Fortran index hackathon focusing on improving fortran-lang's package index
---

The [Fortran index](https://github.com/fortran-index/fortran-index) hackathon
series aims to improve knowledge exchange within the Fortran programming
community by adding, correcting, and curating the information available in the
[fortran-lang](https://fortran-lang.org) community resource.

In this edition, we will work on overhauling the
[package index](https://fortran-lang.org/packages/) to make it more useful for
the Fortran community, e.g., more easily searchable and perhaps with
finer-grained sections.

The event will be hosted online, running on Thursday 5th March 2026 between
14:00 and 16:30 UTC. Register for the hackathon by filling out the following
