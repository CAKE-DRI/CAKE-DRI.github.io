Date to be announced! 

ACIT-Hub is developing efficient and sustainable training solutions, to future proof the skills development of RTPs including SysOps, Infrastructure Engineers, DevOps, System Administrators and Technical Support, who underpin large-scale Accelerated Compute.

Join us at the University of Edinburgh for the ACIT-Hub Scotland training co-design day, we will be exploring the unique needs of technician RTPs to then feed into our plans for the development of bespoke training courses and events covering accelerators, networking, storage, and orchestration and management software.

Come along to help define what training you want to see come out of the hub. We'll be discussing learning journeys with talks from RIE's across the hub and beyond. These events are specifically aimed at Research Infrastructure Engineers (RIE's), these are the technical staff who build and maintain accelerated compute clusters. Later on we'll be doing sessions with the Software Sustainability Institute aimed at RSEs and other users but for these events we're focussing on SysOps, Infrastructure Engineers, DevOps and System Administrators.
