The project aims to addresses one of the UKRI DRI's strategic priority themes around skills gaps. The project will establish data storytelling as a mainstream approach to the communication of data insight. Through an integrated series of face-to-face workshops across the UK, the project will imbue more than 500 early-career researchers with skills in data storytelling thus enabling them to present data-intensive research creatively and intuitively. The project constitutes a nationally enabling platform to engage with data storytelling and effective communication, a tandem of skills that have been recognized as vital by the industry.
