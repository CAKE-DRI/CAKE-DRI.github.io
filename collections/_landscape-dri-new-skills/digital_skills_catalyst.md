The UKRI Digital Research Skills Catalyst will connect researchers and innovators to a catalogue of CPD training materials through the provision of a dynamic learning portal. The portal will provide a sophisticated search function to enable researchers to easily locate training resources appropriate to their level of expertise, research theme and preferred study mode. The portal will also feature an online support service capable of assisting researchers with their project specific enquiries. 

The Digital Skills Catalyst Portal will empower researchers to navigate their professional development with the following features:

- Streamlined access to all the courses provided by the above DaSH projects
- Detailed pre-requisites and outcomes for courses and materials to help assess learning requirements
- Bookable time slots for one-to-one bespoke guidance with a Digital Research Infrastructure specialist from one of the DaSH projects
- Additional accreditation for new and existing courses to cater for Continuing Professional Development needs
- Occasional in-person workshops and networking events to help address ever evolving training needs
