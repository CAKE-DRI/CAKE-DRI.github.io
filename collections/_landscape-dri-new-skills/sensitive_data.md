HDR UK is working with partners across the sector, including the Usher Institute at the University of Edinburgh, University of Dundee, the Software Sustainability Institute at the University of Southampton, and Secure Data Access Professionals network based at the University of Essex to build the skills, knowledge, and capabilities required to support high-quality data curation in Trusted Research Environments (TREs).

Good data curation is a cornerstone of health data research. It guarantees that sensitive data used is handled in ways that protect privacy and confidentiality – it is also critical to ensuring that research outputs are reliable and ethically sound.

HDR UK is taking a lead role in a new two-phase project to gather information on the skills and best practices needed for sensitive and effective data curation within TREs or sensitive data environments (SDEs).

This will ultimately lead to the delivery of consistent, adaptable training to data professionals across TREs and SDEs.
