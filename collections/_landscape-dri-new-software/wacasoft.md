WacaSoft aims to develop a system for managing and automating large-scale weather and climate workflows. This software is designed to work with the massive datasets and complex models involved in weather and climate science, making it easier to run, debug, and utilize these workflows and their outputs. The project focuses on creating tools to handle complex computational tasks and data streams, ultimately aiming to improve how weather and climate information is processed and delivered for various applications
