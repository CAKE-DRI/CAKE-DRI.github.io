The Mathematical Innovators in the Digital Space (MInDS) initiative, hosted by the University of Warwick's Centre for Applications of Mathematical and Computing Sciences (CAMaCS), is a major UK-wide programme aimed at expanding the role of Innovation Research Associates (InRAs) in mathematical sciences. Backed by £2M in NetworkPlus funding from UKRI, MInDS seeks to build a national platform to support and grow the InRA community between 2025 and 2029. InRAs are a new category of Research Technology Professionals who translate mathematical research into real-world impact across academia, industry, and government. The initiative includes funding opportunities for universities to create InRA positions and host events such as sandpits, congresses, and networking sessions to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange.

The InRA role is designed to harness the expertise of PhD graduates in Mathematical Sciences, enabling them to work across disciplinary boundaries to solve complex societal and industrial challenges. These professionals enhance research outcomes through cross-sector collaboration and contribute to national innovation goals. MInDS will provide £860K in co-funding to support the initial stages of InRA roles and will also offer training and career development opportunities. A key goal is to establish a career progression framework that aligns with UK academic promotion criteria, allowing InRAs to advance to permanent and senior roles, including professorial equivalents.

CAMaCS, established in 2023, plays a central role in delivering MInDS. It connects Warwick’s departments of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science with external partners to drive societal impact through interdisciplinary collaboration. CAMaCS is outward-facing and problem-driven, supporting mechanisms such as InRA positions, Impact Research Fellowships, and public engagement initiatives. The centre exemplifies Warwick’s commitment to large-scale knowledge exchange and innovation, drawing on its institutional strengths in applied research and industry partnerships.
