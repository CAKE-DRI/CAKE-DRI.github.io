The STEP-UP project—Strategic TEchnical Platform for University technical Professionals—is a UK-based initiative aimed at supporting and advancing the careers of digital Research Technical Professionals (dRTPs). These professionals work at the intersection of research software, data, and computing infrastructure. Funded by UKRI-EPSRC, the project is led by Imperial College London in collaboration with UCL, King’s College London, and the University of Westminster. While its core focus is the London region, STEP-UP’s reach and impact extend more broadly, aiming to build a sustainable and inclusive community of technical professionals across the UK.

STEP-UP provides a comprehensive support framework that includes mentoring, training, events, and career development opportunities. It seeks to address the evolving needs of dRTPs by fostering professional networks and offering structured learning pathways. These pathways are informed by an ongoing analysis of training needs, ensuring that the resources and opportunities provided are relevant and impactful. The project also hosts events like the RSLondon Conference, which bring together professionals to share knowledge, showcase innovations, and strengthen community ties.

A key ambition of STEP-UP is to develop a strategic, regional platform that not only supports individuals but also strengthens institutional capacity in research computing and data. By aligning with national priorities and leveraging the expertise of its partner institutions, STEP-UP is helping to shape the future of technical research support in academia. Its long-term vision includes influencing policy, improving visibility of technical roles, and ensuring that dRTPs are recognized as essential contributors to the research ecosystem.
