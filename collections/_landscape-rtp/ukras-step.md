Launched in 2024, UK RAS STEPS is a community driven research technology platform to support Research Technical Professionals working in robotics and autonomous systems (RAS) across the UK.
We aim to cultivate a collaborative and inclusive research environment that empowers RAS Research Technical Professionals (RTPs) to advance and develop their careers, by:

- Fostering ongoing professional development through community-driven training opportunities and secondments in academia and industry.
- Supporting the community to address outstanding technical and organisational challenges through open calls for collaborative task groups.
- Facilitating knowledge exchange and raising the profile of UK robotics by supporting RTPs to undertake international visits to world-leading robotics labs.
- Establishing a mentoring scheme to help junior RTPs to flourish in their current role, evaluate career opportunities, and pursue their career aspirations.
- Raising the profile of RAS careers and promoting responsible innovation practices through activities and events that engage members of the public in UK robotics research.
- Promoting and advocating for RTPs through engagement with national and international organisations, industrial groups and government forums.
