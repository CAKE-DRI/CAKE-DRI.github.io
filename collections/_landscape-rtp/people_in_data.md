The People in Data project, led by The Alan Turing Institute, is a national initiative aimed at professionalising and supporting under-recognised data roles across the UK. Recognising the critical importance of data in research and innovation, the project responds to challenges such as inaccessible or poor-quality data and a widespread lack of data skills. It seeks to build a connected and inclusive community hub for data professionals—especially those in emerging roles like data stewards, wranglers, and research engineers—by mapping existing skills, identifying gaps, and developing targeted training resources.

A key goal of the project is to promote a culture that values data and the people who work with it. This includes convening an open community, enhancing data skills and capacity, and developing a sustainable business case for long-term support. The initiative aligns with national strategies such as the UKRI’s vision for a digital research infrastructure and addresses findings from reports like the National Audit Office’s review of data challenges in government. By fostering collaboration among universities, research institutes, government bodies, and industry, the project aims to elevate data literacy and create viable career pathways in data-centric roles.

Partners in the project include ELIXIR-UK, Health Data Research UK, and the Natural History Museum, all of which underscore the urgency and relevance of data skills in tackling global challenges—from environmental monitoring to health data innovation. The project is organised by a multidisciplinary team at The Alan Turing Institute and welcomes engagement from across the UK’s data science ecosystem.
