MUSCAT (Meet Future Needs of Antenna Measurements and RF Characterization for Changing Research Culture), aims to address the national shortage of skilled professionals in this critical field. It will provide advanced training and research opportunities for both academic and industry professionals, supporting the development of Research Technical Professionals (RTPs) and Research Software Engineers (RSEs).

Led by Dr Max Munoz Torrico and supported by a team of experts including Professor Akram Alomainy and Professor Andrew Livingston, MUSCAT will offer bespoke training programmes, workshops, and access to Queen Mary’s state-of-the-art Antennas Measurement Lab. The platform is designed to foster collaboration between academia and industry, helping to tackle real-world challenges and accelerate the commercialisation of research. It aligns with UKRI’s strategic goals to build world-class careers and supports Queen Mary’s commitment to championing technical research roles.

MUSCAT is not only a response to the rapid evolution of telecommunications technology but also a proactive step toward shaping the future of experimental research and metrology. By reskilling and upskilling the workforce, the project will create a vibrant, interdisciplinary hub that drives innovation and supports the UK’s research infrastructure. The EPSRC grant is a recognition of Queen Mary’s leadership in antenna research and its vision for inclusive, forward-thinking technical education.
