The Careers and Skills for Data-driven Research (CaSDaR) initiative is a UKRI-funded programme designed to transform how research data is managed and valued across UK academia. CaSDaR is building a national community of Data Stewards—specialists who ensure research data is well-organised, reusable, and impactful. By funding roles, hosting events, and developing resources, CaSDaR is laying the foundation for a sustainable and inclusive data stewardship ecosystem that supports long-term research excellence.

### Empowering Data Stewards
CaSDaR champions a “learn by doing” model, embedding Data Stewards within research teams across disciplines and institutions. These professionals play a vital role in enabling reproducible science and cross-sector collaboration. The initiative supports career development through training, mentorship, and the creation of formal progression pathways—from entry-level roles to senior, institutionally recognised positions. CaSDaR also provides tools and frameworks to help universities define, support, and promote data stewardship as a core research function.

### Building a Sustainable Future
Led by a multidisciplinary team and supported by national research centres, CaSDaR is driving cultural change in how research data is curated and shared. The project is developing a Data Stewardship Association, a central hub for community building, advocacy, and resource sharing. Through strategic partnerships and infrastructure development, CaSDaR is ensuring that research outputs remain accessible, interoperable, and beneficial for future generations.
