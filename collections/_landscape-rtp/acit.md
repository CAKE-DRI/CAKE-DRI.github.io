The hub will offer translational training in essential skills and work with universities and existing accrediting bodies to provide a professionally recognised talent pool that can drive uptake, in research and industry, of efficient methodologies for deploying, maintaining and using accelerated compute infrastructure. The hub recognises the diversity of backgrounds present in the RIE community and it will reflect this across all training and CPD events.

By providing bespoke training courses and events covering accelerators, networking, storage, and orchestration and management software, highlighting both the fundamental and applied applications of the latest Accelerated Compute technologies, including when to ‘burst to cloud’. This comprehensive and agile training will be co-designed and developed by expert RTPs to ensure that it is relevant, and accessible to all.
