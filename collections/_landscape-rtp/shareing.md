Digital computing platforms, from sensors to supercomputers, are vital for many branches of research and innovation. Increasingly, they are either accelerated by special-purpose hardware - notably in the realm of AI - or act themselves as accelerators to traditional digital research infrastructure (DRI). Such accelerated compute has the potential to drive transformational change in the frontiers of knowledge through enhanced productivity, yet if, and only if, sufficient expertise is available to translate research ambition into technical solutions.

SHAREing will:
- Foster an ecosystem in which RTPs and other stakeholders can design, prototype and assess the best accelerated software-hardware combination for their research, i.e. pioneer solutions.
- Establish structured learning, including upskilling pathways, such that RTPs can acquire all skills to realise accelerated computing projects and to subsequently train others.
- Showcase how RTPsâ€™ interventions enable significant research innovation if they transform into dev-ops that lead accelerate computing projects.
