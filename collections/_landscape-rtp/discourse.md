DisCouRSE will encourage and support the development of leaders across all digital Research Technical Professional (dRTP) roles, resulting in an empowered and connected community equipped to shape the future of digital research.

By focusing on leadership, career pathways, and community collaboration, DisCouRSE will help address long-standing challenges around recognition, progression, and sustainability in [the many roles](https://discourse-network.github.io/who) essential to make effective use of the UKâ€™s digital research infrastructure.
We consider a broad definition of leadership, encompassing strategic, community, and technical leadership, not just management.

The project brings together partners from academia, the public sector, industry, and international networks to ensure broad impact and relevance.
Through its [work packages](https://discourse-network.github.io/workpackages) and flexible funding scheme, DisCouRSE will deliver practical tools, frameworks, and opportunities that strengthen both individuals and institutions. 

DisCouRSE has received funding through the UKRI Digital Research Infrastructure Programme.
