SHAREing is a UK research initiative that funds and shapes future digital research infrastructure activities. It aims to identify priority actions through working groups that run scoping exercises and develop miniproject proposals. It offers funded miniprojects (after consortium approval) and early participation via working groups—currently for members, with plans to open to the wider community. Please contact the working group leads (https://shareing-dri.github.io/about/workinggroups) if you would like to participate.
