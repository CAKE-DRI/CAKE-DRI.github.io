STEP-UP is a UK-based research project funded under the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)’s 2023 Strategic Technical Platforms call.

The project is building a regional, London-based, platform to support the development of communities, skills and career opportunities for "digital Research Technical Professionals (dRTPs)".
