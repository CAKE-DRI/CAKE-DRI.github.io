ScotRSE is the Scottish Research Software Engineer (RSE) network. A vibrant community with regular online calls, February saw one of the first in-person meetups of the group in Dundee. With RSEs from across Scotland, and including SocRSE and the SSI, the overall purpose of the session was to both help better connect the community and explore Scottish specific RSE aspects which might impact the community differently from the rest of the UK due to differences in policy.

The DRI programme led the afternoon part of the event, exploring collaboration and funding opportunities. CAKE gave the afternoon keynote talk describing the DRI programme, the different activities and opportunities, along with the knowledge exchange components. This was then followed by an RSE from Dundee who has benefitted from the DisCouRSE project's flexible fund describing his activities and outcomes.

During these sessions three key themes around exploring challenges to collaboration, potential areas of shared interest, funding for education and Scottish specific concerns. The group broke into separate breakouts to explore these with actionable insights then reported back to the rest of the event.
