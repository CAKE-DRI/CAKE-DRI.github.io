Eleanor Broadway represented the CAKE team at the DRI Congress 2025 by organising an interactive knowledge-exchange session titled *Knowledge Exchange is a Piece of CAKE!*

This session began by introducing the CAKE project, spotlight talks from current DRI projects (SHAREing, CaSDaR, and CHARTED) and then a presentation on building a NetworkPlus community which emphasised coordination and communication across DRI projects to address shared challenges. 

All of this set the scene for attendees to understand the diversity within the DRI landscape, highlighting the importance of coordination, communication, and community-building across DRI initiatives to address shared challenges.

Participants then moved into breakout sessions with each group focused on "baking" solutions to a challenge they have identified. They each developed a recipe - complete with ingredients, method, and even a serving suggestion - to capture their ideas. 

This produced some really great outputs! We had **'Hot (off the press) cakes'** which baked a solution to the challenge of getting the right information to the right people at the right time; **'The Missing Ingredients'** focused on including communities and fields outside traditional Russell Group university science and computing; **'The Fund-Rising Flan'** attempted to get more RTPs to apply for funding and **'(d) Rocky Road'** tackled buildling more sustainable communities.
