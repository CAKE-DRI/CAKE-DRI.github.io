Over the past year or so, Lewis has been slowly gathering Kubernetes (K8s) experts and interested colleagues throughout the Scientific Computing Department (SCD) at STFC into an internal collaboration group. Eventually, this group expanded to include neighboring institutes like RAL Space and the Roselind Franklin Institute (RFI). After collaborating with Laura Shemilt, Alex Lubbock, and Piper Fowler-Wright to form the base of the Cloud Native SIG (CNSIG, an SSI funded fellowship), they ran their first K8s workshop [at RSECon25](https://youtu.be/HBz4nmjiCKE?si=GuQHjKDTlsPs0Cda). 

This RSECon workshop was really well attended with in-person conference attendees unfortunately having to join from their laptops due to a limit on the room. Following this, there was an interest from within SCD to offer an updated internal SCD workshop covering the same topics. In February Lewis and Piper re-ran this workshop to 50 SCD staff, with another successful knowledge. 

The intention for all the CNSIG workshops and resources is that we are able to offer relevant information that can be followed during a hybrid event or completely offline. For any readers interested in trying this themselves please checkout CAKEBox. 

As part of his CAKE fellowship Lewis is planning to fund some additional workshops of a similar content, bridging the gap between the academic experience with K8s and the expansive world of the container management platform. Keep an eye out for Lewis and Piper at Durham HPC Days, [RPi Workshop](https://hpc-days.github.io/Durham-HPC-Days-2026/programme-2026/pocket-sized-tuesday-09-00/) or on the events page for any other notices.
