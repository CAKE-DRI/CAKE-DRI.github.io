## Showing off what UK DRI has to offer - CAKE at CIUK 2025

At the beginning of December, the CAKE team went to [Computing Insight UK (CIUK) 2025 in Manchester](https://www.cake.ac.uk/events/202512-CIUK25/), 
which takes place in the first week of December every year and is sometimes jokingly called the “Christmas Party of the UK HPC community”. 
Although no party in the classical sense, this conference brings together researchers, service providers and practitioners in the UK high performance computing scene. 

The CAKE stall presented both the range of Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) projects currently running the in the UK, 
and funding opportunities offered through CAKE’s flexible funds route - knowledge exchange fellowships, bursaries for visits and placements, 
and funds to organise DRI knowledge exchange retreats. The stall also drew attention from the large Raspberry Pi training cluster provided by the DRIFT project, 
with lots of people being interested in technical details as well as how to use it in HPC training.

On the Friday of the conference, CAKE Co-I Marion was leading the [fourth annual UK Women in HPC Chapters and Affiliates Breakfast](https://womeninhpc.org/events/ciuk-2025-whpc-breakfast), 
attended by over fifty women and male allies, with early career speaker presentations, chapter introductions and discussions. 

CAKE PI Nick presented at in the NetworkPlus session, and was then leading with Phil Hasnip the “From ExCALIBUR to DRI, linking the UK’s compute programmes”. 
Both sessions together gave a comprehensive overview of which DRI projects are currently running in the UK, and how they link in whith each other.

As every year, the event gave an opportunity to network and discuss future collaborations.
