## CAKE at the SSI Research Software Camp

This week was the first of the [2025 SSI Research Software Camp](https://www.cake.ac.uk/events/202511-SSI-RSC/), and CAKE was invited to lead on two sessions.

On Monday, we opened the Software Camp with a panel discussion on "Knowledge Exchange in Research Software - How to ensure that knowledge is shared and maintained ". Marion Weinzierl facilitated and chaired a stellar panel:
 - [Deborah Udoh from Pre-seeds: Research 101](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme/deborah-udoh),
 - [Eamonn Bell from Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/eamonn-bell/),
 - [Emma Karoune from the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme/emma-karoune),
 - [Kristy Pringle from the Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/our-people/kirsty-pringle),
 - [Toby Hodges from The Carpentries](https://tbyhdgs.info/).

The discussion covered the definition and differentiation of knowledge exchange, knowledge sharing, training and outreach, best practices and how to get started, 
as well as the importance of recognition and career pathways. It became apparent that community building and community management are tightly interwoven with succesful knowledge exchange and sharing.

On Wednesday, Eleanor Broadway led a workshop with the topic "Building Sustainable Outreach: Reinvent, Reuse, Repurpose". The session was co-organised by Andrew Gait, Marion Weinzierl, Nick Brown, Oscar Seip, Stefan Piatek, Tobias Weinzierl and Eva Fernandez Amez.
The session explored how outreach can be made more sustainable by building on existing materials. The idea is simple: instead of reinventing the wheel time and time again, let’s use existing materials as the baseline for our own outreach activities. 
Participants took three existing and impactful outreach activities, to discuss how they could be reused, reinvented or repurposed for different contexts. Each of these approaches requires care and attention to important factors, such as accessibility, communication style, 
and background knowledge of the audience. This workshop lowered the barrier to enable those new to outreach to take existing materials and adapt them to their own contexts.
