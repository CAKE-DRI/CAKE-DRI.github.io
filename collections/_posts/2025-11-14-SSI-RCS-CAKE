## CAKE at the SSI Research Software Camp

This week was the first of the [2025 SSI Research Software Camp](https://www.cake.ac.uk/events/202511-SSI-RSC/), and CAKE was invited to lead on two sessions.

On Monday, we opened the Software Camp with a panel discussion on "Knowledge Exchange in Research Software - How to ensure that knowledge is shared and maintained ". Marion Weinzierl facilitated and chaired a stellar panel:
 - [Deborah Udoh from Pre-seeds: Research 101](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme/deborah-udoh),
 - [Eamonn Bell from Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/eamonn-bell/),
 - [Emma Karoune from the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme/emma-karoune),
 - [Kristy Pringle from the Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/our-people/kirsty-pringle),
 - [Toby Hodges from The Carpentries](https://tbyhdgs.info/).

The discussion covered the definition and differentiation of knowledge exchange, knowledge sharing, training and outreach, best practices and how to get started, 
as well as the importance of recognition and career pathways. It became apparent that community building and community management are tightly interwoven with succesful knowledge exchange and sharing.

On Wednesday, Eleanor Broadway led a workshop with the topic "Building Sustainable Outreach: Reinvent, Reuse, Repurpose". The session was co-organised by Andrew Gait, Marion Weinzierl, Nick Brown, Oscar Seip, Stefan Piatek, Tobias Weinzierl and Eva Fernandez Amez.
The session explored how outreach can be made more efficient by building on excisting concepts and resources. At hands of three practical examples it was discussed how material can be reused, repurposed or 
used to reinvent a new outreach activity, while taking into account accessibility and communication aspects.
