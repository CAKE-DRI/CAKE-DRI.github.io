Fortran will turn seventy later this year, making it a very well established
programming language for scientific computing. Over its seven decades of usage,
many high quality learning resources and tools have been developed for the
Fortran. However, their visibility has historically been poor in the community,
with groups often sticking to the resources and tools that they were aware of.

The situation has been greatly improved by the fortran-lang community
initiative, which provides standard tooling, community platforms, and this
website, which holds a large volume of useful information. However, there are
still enchancements that could be made to allow fortran-lang to better serve the
community. For example, having finer-grained categories and the ability to
search by tags in the [package index](https://fortran-lang.org/packages/) would
be very useful.

[Fortran index](https://github.com/fortran-index/fortran-index) is a hackathon
series that was born out of the Back to the Fortran Future satellite event of
[RSECon](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/) back in 2024. Roughly every two
months, the attendees of Fortran index hackathons meet virtually to work on
improvements for fortran-lang - particularly its package index. Some additions
and corrections are made but the focus is on improving the way that information
is presented and curated so that the community can more easily find the
information that they seek.

I am happy to announce that I was recently awarded a
[Computational Abilities Knowledge Exchange (CAKE) fellowship](https://www.cake.ac.uk/ke-fellowships/cohort1#joe-wallwork)
to further the efforts of Fortran index in 2026. Watch this space for useful
improvements. The funding associated with the fellowship will support attending
Fortran! This will be a hybrid event and cake will be provided for in-person
attendees, of course. (Further details to follow.)
events to network with potential contributors both inside and outside the
Fortran community (e.g., web developers) and also hosting the first in-person
hackathon in Cambridge in the autumn... along with a 70th Fortran birthday for
