## CAKE at RSECon25

Despite our poster submission not being accepted for RSECon25 we made our way to Warwick University in Coventry for the conference September 9-11. 
Our colleagues from UKRI DRI, EPCC and Cambridge RCS were happy to add our flyers and pens to their stalls, and we had lots of good chats about our upcoming calls and events.
People are interested to [get involved](cake.ac.uk/involved) and are starting to sign up for our mailinglist and slack workspace, which is exciting!

We are planning to be back next year at RSECon26 in Sheffield, hopefully with lots more to present, and maybe even a couple of our upcoming KE fellows involved...
